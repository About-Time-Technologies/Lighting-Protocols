  A Controller or monitoring device on the network can enable or disable  individual DMX512 inputs on any of the network nodes. This allows the Controller to directly control network traffic and ensures that unused inputs are disabled and therefore not wasting bandwidth. 

  All nodes power on with all inputs enabled. 

  Caution should be exercised when implementing this function in the controller. Keep in mind that some network traffic may be operating on a node to node basis.
