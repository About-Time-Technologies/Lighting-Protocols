  id: artpollreply

doc: |
  A device, in response to a Controller's ArtPoll, sends the ArtPollReply. The device should wait for a random delay of up to 1s before sending the reply. This mechanism is intended to reduce packet bunching when scaling up to very large systems.

  ## Minimum Packet Length

  Consumers of ArtPollReplyshall accept as valid a packet of length 198(highlighted in grey below) octets or larger.Any missing fields are assumed to be zero. This requirement is due to the fact that the length of ArtPollReply has increased over the life of the protocol.

  All:
    Receive: No Art-Net action
    Unicast Transmit: Allowed
    Broadcast: Not Allowed

      The array represents a null terminated short name for the Node. The Controller uses the ArtAddress packet to program this string.
      Max length is 17 characters plus the null.
      This is a fixed length field, although the string it contains can be shorter than the field.

      The array is a textual report of the Node's operating status or operational errors. It is primarily intended for 'engineering' data rather than 'end user' data. The field is formatted as: “#xxxx [yyyy..] zzzzz…”
      xxxx is a hex status code as defined in Table 3. 
      yyyy is a decimal counter that increments every time the Node sends an ArtPollResponse. This allows the controllerto monitor event changes in the Node.
      zzzz is an English text string defining the status.
      This is a fixed length field, although the string it contains can be shorter than the field.

      If the Node supports macro key inputs, this byte represents the trigger values. The Node is responsible for 'debouncing' inputs. When the ArtPollReplyis set to transmit automatically, (Flags Bit 1), the ArtPollReply will be sent on both key down and key up events. However, the Controllershould not assume that only one bit position has changed.
      The Macro inputs are used for remote event triggering or cueing.
      Bit fields are active high.
