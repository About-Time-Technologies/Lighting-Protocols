  title: ArtTodData

doc: |
  The ArtTodData packet is sent from Node Output Gateways in response to an ArtTodRequest from Controller. It is always sent as broadcast.

  | Handling Rules | |
  | -- | -- |
  | **Controller**   ||
  | Receive          | No Action |
  | Unicast Transmit | Not Allowed |
  | Broadcast        | Not Allowed |
  | **Node Output Gateway**         ||
  | Receive          | No Action |
  | Unicast Transmit | Not Allowed |
  | Broadcast        | Output Gateway always Directed Broadcasts this packet |

      Physical port index in a range of 1-4. This number is used with bind_index to identify the physical port that generated the packets. 
    
      `Physical port = (BindIndex - 1)  * ArtPollReply->NumPortsLow + ArtTodDataPort`
    
      Most gateways will implmenet one universe per ArtPollReply so `ArtTodData->Port` will usually be set to a value of 1.

  - id: bind_index
    type: u1
    doc: The Bind Index defines the bound node which originated this packet. In combination with Port and Source IP address, it uniquely identifies the sender. This must match the BindIndex field in ArtPollReply. This number represents the order of bound devices. A lower number means close to root device. A value of 1 means root device.
