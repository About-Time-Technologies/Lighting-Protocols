  title: ArtPoll

doc: |
  The ArtPoll packet is used to discover the presence of other Controllers, Nodes and Media Servers. The ArtPoll packet can be sent by any device, but is usually only sent by the Controller. Both Controllers and Nodes respond to the packet.
  A Controller broadcasts an ArtPoll packet to IP address 2.255.255.255 (sub-net mask 255.0.0.0) at UDP port 0x1936, this is the Directed Broadcast address.
  The Controller may assume amaximum timeout of 3 seconds between sending ArtPoll and receiving all ArtPollReply packets. If the Controller does not receive a response in this time, it should consider the Node to have disconnected.
  The Controller that broadcasts an ArtPoll should also reply to its own message (by unicast) with an ArtPollReply. It is a requirement of Art-Net that all controllers broadcast an ArtPoll every 2.5 to 3 seconds. This ensures that any network devices can easily detect a disconnect.

  ## Multiple Controllers

  Art-Net allows and supports multiple controllers on a network. When there are multiple controllers, Nodes will receive ArtPolls from different controllers which may contain conflicting diagnostics requirements. This is resolved as follows:
  If any controller requests diagnostics, the node will send diagnostics. (ArtPoll->Flags->2).
  If there are multiple controllersrequesting diagnostics, diagnostics shall be broadcast. (Ignore ArtPoll->Flags->3).
  The lowest minimum value of Priority shall be used. (Ignore ArtPoll->DiagPriority).

  ## Targeted Mode

  Targeted mode allows the ArtPoll to define a range of Port-Addresses. Nodes will only reply to the ArtPoll is they are subscribed to a Port-Address that is inclusively in the range TargetPortAddressBottom to TargetPortAddressTop. The bit field ArtPoll->Flags->5 is used to enable Targeted Mode.

  ## Minimum Packet Length

  Consumers of ArtPoll shall accept as valid a packet of length 12 octets or larger. Any missing fields are assumed to be zero. This requirement is due to the fact that the length of ArtPoll has increased over the life of the protocol.

  All:
    Receive: Send ArtPollReply
    Unicast Transmit: Allowed, with Targeted Mode.
    Directed Broadcast: Controller broadcasts this packet to poll all Controllers and Nodes on the network
    Limited Broadcast: Not recommended
