  ArtTimeCode allows time code to be transported over the network. The data format is compatible with both longitudinaltime code and MIDI time code. The four key types of Film, EBU, Drop Frame and SMPTE are also encoded.
  Use of the packet is application specific but in general a single controllerwill broadcast the packet to the network.

    Receive: Application Specific
    Unicast Transmit: Application Specific
    Broadcast: Application Specific
