  ArtVlc is a specific implementation of the ArtNzs packet which is used for the transfer of VLC (Visible Light Communication) data over Art-Net. (The packet's payload can also be used to transfer VLC over a DMX512 physical layer). 

  Fields 2, 6, 11, 12 and 13 should be treated as 'magic numbers' to detect this packet.

      The sequence number is used to ensure that ArtNzs packets are used in the correct order. 
      When Art-Net is carried over a medium such as the Internet, it is possible that ArtNzs packets will reach the receiver out of order.
