# Development Notes
#   * TODO: prog_ip, prog_subnet_mask, prog_port, prog_default_gateway can all be conditional on their entry in command however this is not implemented right now

  The ArtIpProg packet allows the IP settings of a Node to be reprogrammed.
  The ArtIpProg packet is sent by a Controllerto the private address of a Node. If the Node supports remote programming of IP address, it will respond with an ArtIpProgReply packet. In all scenarios, the ArtIpProgReply is sent to the private address of the sender.

  Controller: 
    Receive: No Action
    Unicase Transmit: Controller transmits to a specific node IP address

  Node:
    Receive: Reply with ArtIpProgReply
    Unicast Transmit: Not Allowed
