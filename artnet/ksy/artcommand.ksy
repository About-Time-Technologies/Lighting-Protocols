#   * esta_manufacturer has a misleading description in the spec. It is listed as going Hi Lo, however the description of the fields themselves describe Lo Hi. Based on experimentation, I am pretty sure its Lo Hi however this may need correcting

  The ArtCommand packet is used to send property set style commands. The packet can be unicast or broadcast, the decision being application specific

  The Data field contains the command text. The text is ASCII encoded and is null terminated and is case insensitive. It is legal, although inefficient, to set the Data array size to the maximum of 512 and null pad unused entries.
  
  The command text may contain multiple commands and adheres to the following syntax:

  ```
  Command=Data&
  ```

  The ampersand is a break between commands. Also note that the text is capitalised for readability; it is case insensitive.

  Thus far, two commands are defined by Art-Net. It is anticipated that additional commands will be added as other manufacturers register commands which have industry wide relevance.
  
  These commands shall be transmitted with EstaMan = 0xFFFF
