  A Controlleror monitoring device on the network can reprogram numerous controls of a node remotely. This,for example, would allow the lighting console to re-route DMX512 data at remote locations. This is achieved by sending an ArtAddress packet to the Node’s IP address. (The IP address is returned in the ArtPoll packet). The node replies with an ArtPollReply packet.
  Fields 5 to 13 contain the data that will be programmed into the node

  Controller: 
    Receive: No Action
    Unicase Transmit: Controller transmits to a specific node IP address.
    Broadcast: Not Allowed

  Node:
    Receive: Reply by unicasting ArtPollReply
    Unicast Transmit: Not Allowed

    doc: |
      Bits 14-8 of the 15 bit Port-Address are encoded into the bottom 7 bits of this field. This is used in combination with SubSwitch and SwIn[] or SwOut[] to produce the full universe address.
      This value is ignored unless bit 7 is high. i.e. to program a value 0x07, send the value as 0x87.
      Send 0x00 to reset this value to the physical switch setting.

  - id: bind_index
    type: u1
    doc: |
      The BindIndex defines the bound node which originated this packet and is used to uniquely identify the bound node when identical IP addresses are in use. This number represents the order of bound devices. A lower number means closer to root device.
      A value of 1 meansroot device.

  - id: short_name
    type: str
    encoding: utf8
    size: 18
    doc: |
      The array represents a nullterminated short name for the Node. The Controlleruses the ArtAddress packet to program this string. Max length is 17 characters plus the null. The Node will ignore this value if the string is null.
      This is a fixed length field, although the string it contains can be shorter than the field.

  - id: long_name
    type: str
    encoding: utf8
    size: 64
    doc: |
      The array represents a null terminated long name for the Node. The Controlleruses the ArtAddress packet to program this string. Max length is 63 characters plus the null. The Node will ignore this value if the string is null.
      This is a fixed length field, although the string it contains can be shorter than the field.

    doc: |
      Bits 3-0 of the 15 bit Port-Addressfor a given input port are encoded into the bottom 4 bits of this field.
      This is used in combination with NetSwitch and SubSwitch to produce the full universe address.
      This value is ignored unless bit 7 is high. i.e. to program a value 0x07, send the value as 0x87.
      Send 0x00 to reset this value to the physical switch setting

  - id: acn_priority
    type: u1

      Sets the sACN Priority field for sACN generated on all 4 ports encoded into this packet. A value of 255 represents no change. Values of 0 to 200 inclusive are valid.
