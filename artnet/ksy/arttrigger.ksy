  title: ArtTrigger

doc: |
  The ArtTrigger packet is used to send trigger macros to the network. The most common implementation involves a single controller broadcasting to all other devices.
  In some circumstances a controller may only wish to trigger a single device or a small group in which case unicast would be used.

  ## Key

  The Key is an 8-bit number which defines the purpose ofthe packet. The interpretation of this field is dependent upon the Oem field. If the Oem field is set to a value other than 0xffff then the Key and SubKey fields are manufacturer specific.
  However, when the Oem field = 0xffff the meaning of the Key, SubKey and Payload is defined by Table 7.

  ## SubKey

  The SubKey is an 8-bit number. The interpretation of this field is dependent upon the Oem field. If the Oem field is set to a value other than ffff16 then the Key and SubKey fields are manufacturer specific.
  However, when the Oem field = ffff16 the meaning of the SubKey field is defined by the table above.

  ## Payload

  The Payload is a fixed length array of 512, 8-bit octets. The interpretation of this fieldis dependent upon the Oem field. If the Oem field is set to a value other than 0xffff then the Payload is manufacturer specific
