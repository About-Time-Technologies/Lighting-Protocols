  ## Firmware and UBEA Upgrades

  This section defines the packets used to send firmware revisions to a node. In all instances, communication is private. Under no circumstances should the broadcast address be used. 

  The transaction involves the controller sending multiple ArtFirmwareMaster packets to a Node's IP address. Each packet is acknowledged by the Node with an ArtFirmwareReply. 

  The controller allows a 30 second maximum delay for reception of the ArtFirmwareReply. 

  If the reply is not received in this time, the controller aborts the transaction. The large time period is to allow for Nodes that are writing directly to slow non-volatile memory. 

  The Node allows a 30 second delay between sending an ArtFirmwareReply and receipt of the next consecutive ArtFirmwareMaster. If the next consecutive block is not received within this time, the Node aborts the transaction. In this instance the Node returns to its previous operating system and sets ArtPollReply->Status and ArtPollReply ->NodeReport accordingly.  

  The firmware update file contains a header that defines the Node OEM codes that are valid for this update. The Controller must check this value before sending to a Node. The Node also checks this data on r eceipt of the first packet. If the Node receives a packet with an invalid code, it sends an error  response. 
  
  The UBEA is the User Bios Expansion Area. This is a limited firmware upload mechanism that allows third party firmware extensions to be added to a Node.  

  Manufacturers who implement this feature must document the software interface requirements
