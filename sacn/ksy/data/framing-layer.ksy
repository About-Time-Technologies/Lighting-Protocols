      As in [DMX] systems, the most recent E1.31 Data Packet from a single source supersedes any previous packets from that source (for a more thorough examination of sequence numbers, see 6.7.2). However, a receiver conforming to this standard may receive data for the same universe from multiple sources, as distinguished by examining the CID in the packet. This is a situation that cannot occur in conventional [DMX] systems. The Priority field is an unsigned, one octet field. The value is used by receivers in selecting between multiple sources of data for a given universe number. Sources that do not support variable priority shall transmit a priority of 100. No priority outside the range of 0 to 200 shall be transmitted on the network. Priority increases with numerical value, e.g., 200 is a higher priority than 100.

      For a given universe number, an E1.31 receiver gathering data from multiple sources shall treat data from packets with the highest priority as the definitive data for that universe. The behavior for an E1.31 receiver also doing universe synchronization is undefined, and is beyond the scope of this standard.

      ## Multiple Sources at Highest Priority

      It is possible for there to be multiple sources, all transmitting data at the highest currently active priority for a given universe. When this occurs, receivers must handle these sources in some way.

      A receiver which is only capable of processing one source of data will encounter a sources exceeded condition when two or more sources are present.

      Many devices are capable of combining, merging or arbitrating between the candidate sources by some algorithm (see below), but such algorithms frequently limit the number of concurrent sources which can be handled due to resource limitations, or encounter situations where there are still multiple candidate sources meeting some specified condition, and then, once again, a sources exceeded condition arises which requires resolution.

      ## Note on Merge and Arbitration Algorithms

      A process of combining data from multiple sources to produce a definitive result is called a merge. A process which selects between candidate sources based on some additional selection criterion is called arbitration.

      The single most common merging algorithm, which is usually appropriate to lighting intensity data (e.g. dimmer inputs), is to take the highest (numerically largest) level present from any of the candidate sources slot by slot throughout the universeâ€”Highest Takes Precedence (HTP) merging. A variation of this uses DMX512-A START Code DDh (see [DMX] and http://tsp.esta.org/tsp/working_groups/CP/DMXAlternateCodes.php) to indicate slot-by-slot priority before merging the highest priority data for each slot on an HTP basis.

      For other devices such as movement axes in automated luminaires, HTP is often highly inappropriate. In this case, it is common to accept only one candidate source, but arbitration criteria may be applied e.g. based on information in the Source Name field.

      ## Note on Resolution of Sources Exceeded Condition

      Resolution is required when the number of sources exceeds limitations of the algorithm or of resources available. In the simplest case with no merging or arbitration, this occurs when there is more than one source (at highest active priority).

      One resolution mechanism is to stop accepting data from any source. Other mechanisms may choose one or more from the candidate sources by some overload selection scheme.

      Designers are very strongly discouraged from implementing resolution algorithms that generate different results from the same source combination on different occasions, because this can make sources exceeded conditions hard to detect, makes networks very hard to troubleshoot and may cause unexpected results at critical times. For example, an arbitration scheme which accepts the first source detected at the active highest priority and rejects any subsequent ones is not recommended, as it will produce results dependent on the order of equipment startup and the vagaries of packet timing.

      ## Requirements for Merging and Arbitrating

      The ability of devices to merge or arbitrate between multiple sources at highest active priority shall be declared in user documentation for the device.

      If merging or arbitration is implemented, the maximum number of sources which can be correctly handled shall be declared in user documentation for the device.

      If merging or arbitration is implemented the algorithm used shall be declared in user documentation for the device.

      ## Requirements for Sources Exceeded Resolution
  
      The resolution behavior of equipment under sources exceeded conditions shall be declared in user documentation for the device.

      Receiving devices conforming are strongly recommended to indicate a sources exceeded condition by some means easily detected at the device, e.g., by a flashing indicator, or obvious status message.

      ## Receiving devices may additionally indicate a sources exceeded condition by other means such as remote indication initiated by a network message. This is particularly appropriate for devices which may be hard to access.

      ## Requirements for Devices with Multiple Operating Modes

      Receiving devices which have multiple configurations available to select between different methods for merging and/or Sources Exceeded resolution, shall meet the rules above for each configuration separately. Any configurations in which the device is not compliant with this standard should be clearly declared as such, but are otherwise beyond the scope of this specification.

      The Synchronization Address identifies a universe number to be used for universe synchronization.

      ## Synchronization Address Usage in an E1.31 Data Packet

      E1.31 Synchronization Packets occur on specific universes. Upon receipt, they indicate that any data advertising that universe as its Synchronization Address must be acted upon.

      In an E1.31 Data Packet, a value of 0 in the Synchronization Address indicates that the universe data is not synchronized. If a receiver is presented with an E1.31 Data Packet containing a Synchronization Address of 0, it shall discard any data waiting to be processed and immediately act on that Data Packet.  
      
      When receiving an E1.31 Data Packet with a nonzero Synchronization Address, any receiver which does not support universe synchronization shall ignore the Synchronization Address and process the received data stream normally.

      If the Synchronization Address field is not 0, and the receiver is receiving an active synchronization stream for that Synchronization Address, it shall hold that E1.31 Data Packet until the arrival of the appropriate E1.31 Synchronization Packet before acting on it.

      A receiver that supports universe synchronization must not attempt to synchronize any data on a Synchronization Address until it has received its first E1.31 Synchronization Packet containing that address.

      In a routed network environment it is possible for packets to be received in a different order to the one in which they were sent. The sequence number allows receivers or diagnostic equipment to detect out of sequence or lost packets.

      Sources shall maintain a sequence for each universe they transmit. The sequence number for a universe shall be incremented by one for every packet sent on that universe. There is no implied relationship between the sequence number of an E1.31 Synchronization Packet and the sequence number of an E1.31 Data Packet on that same universe.

          When set to 1 in an E1.31 Data Packet, this bit indicates that the source of the data for the universe specified in this packet has terminated transmission of that universe. Three packets containing this bit set to 1 shall be sent by sources upon terminating sourcing of a universe. Upon receipt of a packet containing this bit set to a value of 1, a receiver shall enter network data loss condition.
